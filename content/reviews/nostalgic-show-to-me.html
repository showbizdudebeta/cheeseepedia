this show has been nostalgic too me because fun fact, it was one of the first RAE Show-tape's
that id had listened too, Song's Like Goin Crazy, Music Goes Round and Round and my very first RAE song I had heard Mr. Bassman, also some of the Gee Our First Album Shows are on here that I like one being Sal's Birthday Who Was Written by Burt ''Sal'' Wilson'' and Billy Bob, and the Rest of the RAE Characters made your Birthday feel really special, even though I was born in 2009 I always loved listening to the show-tapes online , 
Also, When Fatz Plays His Song it's probably one of the best early RAE Show-tapes out there that song being ''Music Goes Round and Round'' which was also featured on some commercials at the time, so I would say this show-tape is a good way for new rock a fire fan's who want to experience the song's
