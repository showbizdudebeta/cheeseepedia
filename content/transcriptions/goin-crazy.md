**Everyone: (Singing)**
I've Been Goin' Crazy 
Can't Hold on To Long
Seems That Youve Been Pushing Mean Girl Mighty Hard 
Can't You See I'm Leaving 
Can't Take Much of You  
I Don't Like Your Boss and You Treat Me Like Your Fool
**Dook LaRue: (Singing)**
Well I'm On My Way 
Where The Sun Shine's Bright Each Day 
Girl, Can't You See 
Your Love's No Good for Me Anymore 
Sock It to Me 
**Everyone :(Singing) **
I'm Still Goin Crazy
Got You on My Mind
I Sure Miss Your Lovin
I'll Come Back One More Time 
I've Been Goin Crazy
I've Been Goin Crazy
I've Been Goin Crazy
I've Been Goin Crazy
