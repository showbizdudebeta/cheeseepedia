**Helen Henny:** 

Chuck E., last week I spilled grape juice on Pasqually and I just didn’t know what to say!

**Pasqually:**

Oh that was nothing, Miss Helen. One time I forgot to add the flour to the pizza

**Helen Henny:**

You’re kidding!

**Pasqually:** 

I didn’t know what to tell them

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Jasper, what did that little guy tell you last week?

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)** 

Well a little guy told me just the other day. 

His daddy said "Son, get all those toys put away." 

The little guy just ran outside and started to play. 

When his daddy tracked him down this is all he could say. 

“Whoops, wow, who me? Nothing up my sleeve, see? Gosh, golly, oh geez. Zap bap diddle dee. 

Whoops, wow, who me? I'm the one you wanna see? Gosh, golly, oh geez. Zap bap boom”

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

Well the coach said "Munch, you better go run a mile." he said

**Mr. Munch:** 

"Sure thing coach, I'll be back in a while."

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

But working up a sweat just ain't munch’s style. When he tried to explain, he told the
coach with a smile

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

And Chuck E. found himself in this black tie situation. 

He was supposed to deliver some sort of verbal dissertation. 

But when he stepped up to the mic he was full of exasperation. 

He forgot the speech and so he used improvisation, hahaha!

**All: (Singing)** 

Whoops, wow, who me? Nothing up my sleeve, see? Gosh, golly, oh geez. Zap bap diddle dee.

Whoops, wow, who me? I'm the one you wanna see? Gosh, golly, oh geez. Zap bap boom

**Helen Henny: (Singing)** 

When teacher gives you homework, it's a thing you should do. 

Forget about the TV and your play friends too. 

Apply yourself and soon you'll be a smart buckaroo

**Pasqually: (Singing)** 

But what do you do if you're at the zoo and a kangaroo takes your homework from you?

**Kids:** 

A kangaroo?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Now I’ve heard everything

**All: (Singing)** 

Whoops, wow, who me? Nothing up my sleeve, see? Gosh, golly, oh geez. Zap bap diddle dee. 

Whoops, wow, who me? I'm the one you wanna see? Gosh, golly, oh geez. Zap bap boom

**Kids: (Singing)** 

There's times I can't explain all the things that are in my brain. So I hope you understand it when I say

**All: (Singing)** 

Zap bap boom

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You know, a few weeks ago, a kid was standing right here in front of me, and he told another kid he didn’t like him because his tennis shoes were the wrong color. His tennis shoes. Friends, one of the things that makes us special is the fact that we can all be different and it's ok. That’s why there are so many different toppings for the pizzas. And I believe the band has something to say on the subject. Take it, group

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

I know I'm purple and I don't see too many purple people around. Does that mean I'm different?

**Helen Henny: (Singing)** 

How many female hen singers do you know up in this town? That's what I am

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

And we're proud to be unique

**Chuck E. Cheese & Helen Henny & Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

Just cause I don't look like you, I deserve respect, it's true. Please remember I've got feelings too

**Pasqually: (Singing)** 

I'm from Italy, English is not always easy for me. But I can speak two languages

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)** 

City folks tell me my voice sounds kinda twangy. You know I can't help where I was born

**Jasper T. Jowls & Pasqually: (Singing)** 

And we're proud to be unique

**All: (Singing)** 

Just cause I don't talk like you, I deserve respect, it's true. Please remember I've got feelings too

**Kids: (Singing)** 

So I don't go to your school. Does that make me some kind of fool? Give me a chance and then you'll see I'm cool

**All: (Singing)** 

Just cause I don't look like you, I deserve respect, it's true. Please remember I've got feelings too

**Kids: (Singing)** 

You know the real me. You know the real me. You know the real me

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Wow, I’m feeling real good. Hey, we’ve got a lot more music to play so don’t go far. We’ll be right back
