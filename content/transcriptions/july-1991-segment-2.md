**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Pasqually, I like this song of yours even though it’s not country

**Pasqually:**

Just think of it as country music that’s indigenous to another country

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Indige what?

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

When we're feeling kinda draggy and our spirits all are low, our drummer friend has got
the thing to get us on the go

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

It's a lively dance from way back when, 

folks dance both night and day. 

We'd like you to join us when you hear the music play

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka

**Pasqually:**

Everybody get up and dance!

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka

**Pasqually:**

Ah hahaha, Yes!

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka, 

just get up on your feet 

and do the Polish dance that's got the bouncy polka beat. 

The polka. 

The polka

**Pasqually:**

Come on, everybody

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka, 

just drop what you're doing and dance

**Pasqually:**

How can you just sit there? Grab your partner everybody on the floor! 

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

You should think of lederhosen when you hear this little song

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

And Saint Bernards and snowy alps and horns a mile long

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

In Bavaria, they dance like this with scarcely a good reason, 

and it's so fun that we're declaring

**Pasqually:**

Polka dancing season!

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka. When Pasqually says polka

**Pasqually:**

Polka, polka, polka

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka, 

just get up on your feet 

and do the Polish dance that's got the bouncy polka beat. 

The polka

**Pasqually:**

My favorite dance, yes

**All: (Singing)**

The polka

**Pasqually:**

Everybody’s doing it now, yes

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka, just drop what you're doing and dance

**[Pasqually & Jasper yodel]**

**Mr. Munch: (Simultaneously)**

 I’m afraid to ask but uh, what is that?

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka

**Pasqually:**

That’s right

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka

**Pasqually:**

When I say “polka” I mean it

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka, 

just get up on your feet 

and do the Polish dance that's got the bouncy polka beat. 

The polka. 

The polka

**Pasqually:**

Come on everybody, it’s contagious

**All: (Singing)**

When Pasqually says polka, just drop what you're doing and dance

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Folks, the band is kinda like a team. Even though we sometimes have different ideas and
different moods

**Mr. Munch:**

When we go on stage we’re like a whale out to sea

**Pasqually:**

It doesn’t matter if you’re playing the drums

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Or playing basketball

**Helen Henny:**

As long as you have team spirit

**Chuck E. Cheese + Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

The summer sun is bright now. 

It's time to go out and play

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Come on

Chuck + **Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

And you'll be doing alright now 

if you do what I say, yeah

**All: (Singing)**

Be a sport sport 

be a sport sport player. 

Be a sport sport

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Don't you lose your cool

**All: (Singing)**

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

A good sport knows how to follow the rules

**All: (Singing)**

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

That way you'll never look a fool

**Helen Henny:**

Munch, do you ever get mad when you don’t win?

**Mr. Munch:**

Well let's say I don’t exactly jump up and down when I lose, but uh...know what I mean?

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

When you're playing a team sport 

you'll wanna give it your best, yeah. 

But sometimes tempers can get short. 

Give your patience a test

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

I like competition, I like giving it all. 

When I play my position, I feel 10 feet tall

**All: (Singing)**

Be a sport sport

Be an example for the rest. 

Cause being a sport is being the best. 

Be a sport sport

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You can play at our place

**All:**
