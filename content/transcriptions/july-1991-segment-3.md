**Pasqually:**

You know, for me the biggest adventure of all is always the annual family summer
vacation

**Helen Henny:**

When you pack up the car, pull out the map

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And head for those places that are tranquil, quiet, and untouched by the screaming
masses

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam, 

where the deer and the antelope play

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Where seldom is heard a discouraging word

**Chuck E. Cheese & Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

And the sky is not cloudy all day

**Kids: (Singing)**

Home, home on the range

**Pasqually: (Singing)** (simultaneously)

Home on the range

**Kids: (Singing)**

Where the deer and the antelope play

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Yeehaw

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Where seldom is heard a discouraging word

**Kids & Helen Henny: (Singing)**

And the skies are not cloudy all day

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You know, this singing is hard work

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

My arm kinda wears out

**Pasqually:**

I don’t know about you folks, but if I sit here and play these drums...

**All:**

Pasqually!

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Having fun 

sounds good to me 

and I’d have some if I could, 

but folks like me can only see 

a good time when our boss thinks we should

**All: (Singing)**

50 weeks a year are punching the clock 

and doing what the boss says to do. 

I’ve earned some time away after 5 o’clock today. 

Me and Mother Nature have our yearly rendezvous

**Chuck E. Cheese & Pasqually: (Singing)**

I’m on vacation. Take a message

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Feed the dog and water that lawn

**Chuck E. Cheese & Pasqually: (Singing)**

I’m on vacation and by the way

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Don’t try to reach me while I’m gone

**All: (Singing)**

Home, home on the range 

where the deer and the antelope play. 

Where seldom is heard a discouraging word 

and the skies are not cloudy all day

**All: (Singing)**

I’m on vacation

**Kids: (Singing)**

On the range

**All: (Singing)**

Take a message

**Kids: (Singing)**

Where the antelope play

**All: (Singing)**

Feed the dog and water the lawn

**Kids: (Singing)** (simultaneously)

I’m out there on the range

**All: (Singing)**

I’m on vacation

**Kids: (Singing)** (simultaneously)

Yeah!

**All: (Singing)**

And you can find me where the skies are not cloudy all day!

**Kids: (Singing)**

Yeehaw!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

What’s on your mind, Helen?

**Helen Henny:**

Thank you

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You’re welcome. Now do you feel like telling me?

**Helen Henny:**

Listen up, silly. I’m trying to think of a way to say thanks to someone special

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

What a neat idea, you think a song might work?

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

The thought did cross my mind. 

**Helen Henny: (Singing

I press my nose to the window pane and I stare. 

But the cars don't stop here and when you don't appear 

I start to give into despair. 

But just that quick you're walking through my door. 

What was black now is white you make everything right. 

My spirits start to soar

**All: (Singing)**

Having fun 

is much more fun 

when I'm having fun with you. 

Having fun is 

much more fun

when I'm having fun with you

**Kids: (Singing)**

Having fun with you

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

A lot of years we've been meeting here playing games. 

When you stand next to me, I'm the best I can be. 

I'll never be the same

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

When we first met, you were really just a kid. 

But you've grown big and tall, I must thank you for all 

the wonderful things you did

**All: (Singing)**

Having fun 

is much more fun 

when I'm having fun with you. 

Having fun 

is much more fun

when I'm having fun with you

**Kids: (Singing)**

Having fun with you

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

I've tried to count all of the times you made me laugh, but I gave up

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Cause I'm afraid I'm not that good in math

**Kids:**

We’ll help

**All: (Singing)**

Having fun 

is much more fun 

when I'm having fun with you. 

Having fun 

is much more fun

when I'm having fun with you

**Pasqually:**

much much more fun

**All: (Singing)**

Having fun 

is much more fun 

when I'm having fun with you

**Pasqually:**

Everybody sing

**All: (Singing)**

Having fun 

is much more fun 

when I'm having fun with you

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Now that I think about it

**Helen Henny:**

Good times are even better when you share them with other people

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

You took the words right out of my snout

**Helen Henny:**

Snout?

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yeah, see?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well, we'd like to thank you all for coming and sharing with us our summertime fun
show. And I’d like to present to you our cast, Helen Henny, Pasqually, Jasper Jowls, Mr. Munch,
and I’m your host Chuck E. Cheese reminding you, this summer have fun.
