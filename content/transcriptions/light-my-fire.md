**[Song: Light My Fire]**
**Dook: (singing)**

You know that it would be untrue 
You know that I would be a liar 
If I was to say to you, girl we couldn't' get much higher  
So come on baby light my fire 
Come on baby light my fire 
try to set the night on fire 

**Dook: (singing)**
 time for hesitation is through 
time to wallow in the mire 
try now we can only loose 
and our love become a funeral pyre 
Come on baby light my fire 
Come on baby light my fire 
try to set the night on fire, yeah 
know that it would be untrue
know that I would be a liar 
if I were to say to you, girl we couldn't get much higher 
so come on baby light my fire  
come on baby light my fire  
trying to set the night on fire  
trying to set the night on fire  
trying to set the night on fire  
trying to set the night on fire!
