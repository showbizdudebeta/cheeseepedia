**Pasqually:** 

Hey everybody, I have a game we can all play!

**All:** 

Alright 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

I hope it’s something that I can win.

**All:** 

Me too!

**Pasqually:** 

It’s not really a game where you win or lose you see it’s..it’s… 

**All:** 

Yeah? 

**Pasqually:** 

It’s like this. 

**[Song: Guessing Game]**

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Here's a little guessing game we can play. 

Let's look down the road 10 years from today. 

When people come and listen to Mr. Munch's band, 

what kind of music will they hear then? 

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Well let’s hear from the leader of the band 

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

Now rap music’s sure to be the happening thing. 

In 10 years time rap music will be king. 

It's the music of the streets and I'll tell you what'll happen,

 a decade from now the whole world will be rapping!

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Alright Munch, your predictions are duly noted 

**Helen Henny:** 

But I wanna know what Jasper thinks 

**Jasper T. Jowls: ** 

Instead of rapping it, I think I’ll sing it. 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

It don't take lots of schooling to figure this one out, 

country music's the only style we could never live without. 

It soothes you when you're sadly and excites you when you're gladly. 

I reckon every boy and girl will someday love it madly!

**Pasqually:** 

Do si do, aha! 

**Mr. Munch:** 

Yeah, you can take Jasper out of the country 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

But you can’t take the country out of the kid. Helen, you care to take a guess? 

**Kids: (Singing)** 

Guessing game. Guessing game. Guessing game. 

Guessing game. Guessing game. Guessing game 

**Helen Henny:**

Listen boys, when it comes to music there’s no guessing here. 

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Move over fellas cause I've got some news, 

Nothing beats dancing for shaking the blues. 

People like music that tickles their feet. 

The future belongs to a dancing beat 

**Kids:** 

Guessing game. Guessing game. Guessing game. 

Guessing game. Guessing game. Guessing game 

**Mr. Munch:** 

Well, you got a point about that dancing thing. Of course when you’re my size you tend to crush peoples feet every now and then. 

**Pasqually:** 

Mr. Chuck E, I believe it’s your turn, though 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

Rock n Roll music is the way things are going. 

Electric guitars really get my blood flowing. 

If you come and see this band 10 years from today 

I guarantee you we'll be rocking away 

**Helen Henny:** 

Ooh, tear it up, Chuck E. 

**Pasqually:** 

Well then, that’s everybody 

**All:** 

The kids? 

**Pasqually:** 

Mama Mia, how could I be so stupid? Take it group

**Kids: (Singing)** 

We think this game is fun but we'd rather see 

a future filled with musical diversity. 

In 10 years time, music may be bizarre, 

but we like Mr. Munch's band just the way they are 

**All: (Singing)** 

Guessing game. Guessing game. Guessing game. 

Guessing game. Guessing game. Guessing game 

Guessing game. Guessing game. Guessing game. 

Guessing game. Guessing game. Guessing game 

**[Children start all crowding around Chuck and talking]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Hey, hold on you guys. We gotta get going 

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

But, but wait Chuck E, have a riddle. What do you always have even when it’s not with you? 

**Helen Henny:** 

Homework? 

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

No, silly, a friend 

**Helen Henny:** 

Oh 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Good point, Jasper. You know, gang, we should tell all our friends how much we’ve enjoyed entertaining them today 

**Pasqually:**

Let's do it 

**Mr. Munch:** 

Yeah 

**[Song: See You Soon my Friend]**

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

We'd like to say how nice it was to have you here today. 

My how time flies when we have fun, how can it be our time is done? 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)** 

It means a lot when you take time to spend your day with me. 

It makes me feel important and I mean that honestly 

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch & Pasqually: (Singing)** 

Though it's time to go I'll keep my head held high.

I really had a great time today. 

Friends like us don't even need to say goodbye. 

We know we'll see each other so we say 

**All: (Singing)** 

See you soon my friend. 

**Kids: (Singing)**

See you soon my friend

**All: (Singing)**

See you soon my friend. 

**Kids: (Singing)**

**All: (Singing)**

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

How many days till you return? 

I'll count them tick tick tick. 

It seems a silly thing to do but when you're gone I miss you 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

Now off you go until next time, I'll think of you each day. 

Just leave me with a smile that I can hold while you're away

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch & Pasqually: (Singing)** 

Though it's time to go I'll keep my head held high. 

I really had a great time today. 

Friends like us don't even need to say goodbye. 

We know we'll see each other so we say 

**All: (Singing)**

**All: (Singing)**

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

And so long for now. But before we go, I’d like to thank my co-stars. Helen Henny, Jasper T. Jowls, Pasqually, and the leader of the band, Mr. Munch. Oh, by the way, I’m Chuck E Cheese. We had a great time entertaining you today and we want you to stick around for more. We’ll be back in a little bit. So long
