**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Hello there, ladies and gentlemen 

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

And howdy to all you boys and girls, too 

**Mr. Munch:** 

Boy do we have a special treat for everybody 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Right as usual, Munch. A rip roaring 

**Helen Henny:** 

Flag waving 

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Old fashioned salute to the greatest nation there ever was 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

The United States of America 

**[Song: America The Beautiful]**

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)** 

Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain 

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

For purple mountains majesties 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

Above the fruited plain 

**All: (Singing)** 

America, America. 

God shed his grace on thee 

and crown thy good with brotherhood 

from sea to shining sea 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Pick it up, band. 

**[Song: Yankee Doodle]**

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

My father and I went down to camp along with captain Goodwin

**Chuck E. Cheese & Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

There we saw the men and boys as thick as tasty pudding 

**Helen Henny: (Singing)** 

Yankee Doodle keep it up, 

Yankee Doodle dandy. 

**Kids: (Singing)** 

Mind the music and the steps and keep the pizza handy 

**Pasqually:** 

Jasper T. Jowls, sing these folks a song! 

**[Song: Oh! Susanna]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)** 

Well I come from Alabamy with my banjo on my knee, 

and I’m going to Louisiany, my true love for to see 

**Jasper T. Jowls & Mr. Munch:** 

Oh, Susanna oh don’t you cry for me, 

cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

It rained all night the day I left, 

the weather was bone dry 

**Pasqually: (Singing)** 

The sun so hot I froze to death, 

Susanna don’t you cry 

**All: (Singing)** 

Oh, Susanna oh don’t you cry for me. 

I’ve come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee 

**Kids:** 

Hey! 

**Helen Henny:** 

Oh, I love those old songs!

**Mr. Munch:** 

Yeah, so do I.

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Why don’t we get everybody in the audience to sing along with us? 

**Pasqually:** 

That’s a great idea. Personally, I’ve got a soft spot for America The Beautiful.

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

America it is, then. Folks, won’t you join us? 

**[Song: America the Beautiful]**

**Kids & Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

Oh beautiful 

for spacious skies, 

for amber waves of grain. 

For purple mountains majesties 

above the fruited plains 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

You know it already 

**All: (Singing)** 

America, 

America. 

God shed his grace on thee 

and crown thy good with brotherhood 

from sea to shining sea 

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Every day, we stand up here and look at a pretty remarkable sight!

**Mr. Munch:** 

Yeah, he’s talking about all the great kids that laugh and enjoy themselves right along with us.

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

It got us thinking on how important kids really are!

**Pasqually:** 

And this is what we came up with.

**[Song: Children Of America]**

**Helen Henny: (Singing)** 

To the children of America that they might live in freedom 

**Pasqually: (Singing)** 

To the children of America that they will live in peace 

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:** 

To the children of America we make this promise 

**Pasqually: (Singing)** 

To keep the air they breathe 

**Helen Henny: (Singing)** 

And all the trees they see 

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:** 

As fresh and green as they can be 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)** 

And every girl and boy can share the love and joy 

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)** 

That come with true equality 

**Pasqually:** 

This is our wish 

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls & Pasqually: (Singing)** 

To the children of America that they will grow and prosper. 

To the children of America that they will live in peace. 

To the children of America we make this promise 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)** 

The lakes and the streams 

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

The hopes and the dreams 

**Helen Henny: (Singing)** 

Always full. Our future lies in you 

**Pasqually: (Singing)** 

For you to speak your mind 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)** 

For the future you'll find 

**All: (Singing)** 

Because of freedom we are strong. 

To the children of America that they might live in freedom.
