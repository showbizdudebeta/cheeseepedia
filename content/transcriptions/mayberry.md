**[Song: Mayberry]**
**Jasper T. Jowls: (singing)**
 Sometimes it feels this world is Spinning faster 
Then it did in the old day's 
So naturally we have more natural disasters 
From the strain of a fast pace 
Sunday was a day of rest 
Now it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down 
Cause more is less 
It's all an endless progress 

**Jasper T. Jowls and Helen Henny :(singing) **
I miss Mayberry 
Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry coke  
We're everything is black and white 
Picking on a sixth string 
People pass you by and you call them by their first name 
Watching the clouds roll by 
Bye-Bye 

**Jasper T. Jowl's: (singing)**
Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting
Through the tree's as the wind blow's 
That's when I climb up here on this mountain 
To look through God's window 
Now I can't fly, but I got two feet 
To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets 
My worries disappear
**Jasper T. Jowl's and Helen Henny: (singing)**
I miss Mayberry 
Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry coke 
We're Everything is black and white 
Picking on the sixth string 
People pass you by and you call them by their first name
Watching the cloud roll by 
**Jasper T. Jowls :(singing)**
Sometimes I dream I'm driving an old dirt road 
Not even listed on a map 
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole 
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back 
I miss Mayberry 
Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry coke 
We're Everything is black and white 
Picking on the sixth string 
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name 
Watching the cloud's roll by 
Bye-Bye 
Bye-Bye
