**Chuck E. Cheese:**

It’s showtime everybody, and to make it a magical show, we’re gonna set the stage using
your imagination. Make believe it’s a warm autumn night, add a sky filled with stars, now add a
big romantic moon, and finally, add the rhythm of the night

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

When it feels like the world is on your shoulders 

and all of the madness has got you going crazy. 

It's time to get out, step out into the street 

where all of the action is right there at your feet. 

Well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away 

underneath electric stars

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Well a name is just a name. It’s the person behind it that makes the name special

**Mr. Munch:**
