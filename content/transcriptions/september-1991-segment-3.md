**All: (Singing)**

Well my daddy really loves music that I know 

and he passed that love along to me.

And I wonder what was playing on his radio

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Back in 1983

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

The tunes were cool and the dancing hot I can't deny 

the eighties baby were high flying fun and divine

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Remember that wonderful time?

**All: (Singing)**

Well my daddy's daddy loved music that I know 

and he passed that love along to me.

And I wonder what was playing on his radio

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Back in 1963

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

That was the age of Rock n Roll.

Electric guitars took control.

A rocking beat had swept the land.

Rock n Roll was in command.

But it was all just fun and games you see

**All: (Singing)**

Back in 1963

**All: (Singing)**

Well my daddy's daddy's daddy loved music I know 

and he passed that love along to me.

And I wonder what was playing on his radio

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Back in 1943

**All: (Singing)**

Remember we're talking bout way back when.

Television didn't exist then.

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

So music music music was the biggest game in town.

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls & Pasqually: (Singing)**

The bands were blasting all night long

laying down a bopping song.

The dancers flipped jittered away.

Man those bands could really play.

**All: (Singing)**

And I bet my people fit right in on the music loving kin.

Well this story so it goes from the beginning of time.

My family loves to hear the music play 

and I hope that when my grandkids are all grown up

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

They'll be singing and dancing away

**All: (Singing)**

Well my daddy really loves music, 

and his daddy really loved music.

Great grandpa loved music, 

and we love our music.

We love our music.

We love our music today.
