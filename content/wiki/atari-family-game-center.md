The ***Atari Family Game Center* (Also known as the ***Atari Leisure Time Game Center*{{< cite 1 >}} and ***Atari Game Center*{{< cite 2 >}}), was a set of mall arcades predating the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} concept from April of 1974 to Spring of 1975.{{< cite 3 >}}
The arcades would exclusively house Atari arcade games, built with custom cabinets to fit the interior design of the locations. The locations would also offer pinball machines and a variety of board games to play. Patrons could also purchase their own Atari arcades from the store for individual use or for small private organizations.https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/jerry_donaldson/interview_jerry_donaldson.html{{< cite 4 >}}******
