The ***CEC Cares Employee Relief Fund*** (Also known as ***Chuck E. Cares Family Assistance Program***) is an employee relief fund for unexpected financial crises and hardships of Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza employees that started on March 30, 2000.

## Fund Collection

The funds are acquired through payroll deductions, direct contributions, CEC product sales, and golf tournaments. As of 2013, the company stated that all employee contributions would be matched by CEC Corporate up to a maximum of $20,000 per year.
