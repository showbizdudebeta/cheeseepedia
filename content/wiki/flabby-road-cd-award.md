**Flabby Road** is a platinum poster released in 1991 made by Showbiz Pizza Inc. It is a parody of Abby Road by The **Beatles*.  

## Appearance

This features Chuck E, Helen, Munch and Jasper walking on Abby Road while Mr. Munch is waking backwards, Pasqually would also be absent from this decor piece because of the original photo having 4 people. 

## Size/Dimensions 

Like other platinum posters, these posters would be larger than actual album posters so it be easy to retrofit the original posters for new ones.
