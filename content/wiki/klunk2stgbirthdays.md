***3 Klunk B-Days for 2-Stage Shows*** is a semi-lost showtape that played alongside {{< wiki-link "Fatz Showtape (Uncle Klunk Install 2 Stg)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Uncle Klunk Showtape" >}}, alongside any future appearance of Klunk at ShowBiz.

The only footage of the tape comes from {{< wiki-link "North Richland Hills, TX (7935 Grapevine Hwy)" >}} in January of 1985, showing Beatles Birthday with Rolfe/Klunk's stage curtains fully closed. The tape is likely just the {{< wiki-link "3-Birthday Reel" >}} in its entirety with the curtain closed.

## Segment List
Only one segment has been fully confirmed for the tape.

- Beatles Birthday
