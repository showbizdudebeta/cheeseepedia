The ***Studio C Technician Terminal,* or 'Studio C Tech Term', is a handheld device used for configuring and testing the {{< wiki-link "Studio C" >}} programmable movements and lights.
The device can check and switch which programming banks, called DTUs (Digital Terminal Units), allow manual diagnostics for single movements on the show{{< cite 1 >}}, and 'blind' movements, which will prevent them from receiving data to turn on. This allows movements that break during a performance to not cause further damage until maintenance can occur at a later time.{{< cite 2 >}}**
